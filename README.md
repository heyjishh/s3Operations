# s3 - Operations and Core Functionality Implementation
Within the scope of this project, I have effectively executed the fundamental operations by leveraging Express, mirroring the essence of S3, even though devoid of direct S3 integration. These operations primarily encompass the unadorned CRUD processes.
To gain entry to this project, just follow these commands:
- Execute 'npm install' to conveniently install the indispensable dependencies.
- Trigger 'npm run start' to set it in motion.
